Distributor
===========

Run a command on many machines at once, over SSH.

From the command line:

    distribute hosts.txt input.txt command foo bar

From Python:

    import distributor.distribute as d
    d.distribute(["host1", "host2"], "input.txt", "command", ["foo", "bar"])

See the docs in `bin/distribute` and `modules/distributor/distribute.py` for full details.
